Walsh Hadamard transform for auto-vectorizing compilers

' The Walsh Hadamard transform arranged for auto-vectorizing compilers
' to create efficient code. Set compiler optimizations correctly.
' Written in FreeBasic 1.07.1, FreeBasic emits C code with is compiled
' (& auto-vectorized) by gcc.  For FreeBasic use the -O 3 optimization option. 

I will see if the Java Hotspot Just-In-Time compiler will also auto-vectorize this arrangement.
That would be quite useful.
